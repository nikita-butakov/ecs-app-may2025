# 🚀 ECS Demo App — My DevOps Project with AWS ECS & GitHub Actions

Hi! I’m Nikita a DevOps Engineer, and this is my personal project where I built and deployed a Python web app to **AWS ECS Fargate** using **Docker** and **GitHub Actions** — 100% automatically.

The goal was to practice and demonstrate real DevOps skills with cloud services and CI/CD automation.

## 🧰 What I Used

- ✅ Python + Flask (simple REST app)
- ✅ Docker (for containerizing)
- ✅ Amazon ECR (to store Docker images)
- ✅ Amazon ECS Fargate (for serverless deployment)
- ✅ GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipeline)

## 🌍 What the App Does

When the project is deployed, you can open it in a browser and see the project page.
